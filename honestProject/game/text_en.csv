Through the veil of sleep, someone's hand reaches out to you. The tips gently touch your cheeks. Your fingers burn your cheeks with a chilly cold, like a spring droplet making its way through the last snowdrifts. Just a touch. No more no less. You can't remember whose hands these are. How can you not remember when this happened? But for some reason you are completely sure that this is a parting touch.

A loud knock on the door brings you back to the real world. Something urgent must have happened, since your assistant came to wake you up personally. Having stretched well, you jump into your slippers and, scratching your side, head towards the door.
